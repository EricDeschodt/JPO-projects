DESCRIPTION
    [MY_DEFENDER]

Our game is inspired by the mobile game Infinitode 2.
The Goal is to survive all the waves.
The waves are composed of 3 types of enemies, circles, squares, and triangles.

(The arrows moving at the begining of the level aren't enemies,
there are showing you the way ennemies will come).

Your goal is to protect the base from enemies.
If an ennemy hits the base you lose 2 hitpoints. (You only have 20)

To stop enemy waves you'll need to place turrets in a smart way.
In this game there are four types of turrets :

-> The Basic (48 gold)
1v1 type turret with medium rate of fire, medium damage and medium range.

-> The Big Bertha (60 gold)
Area of effect type turret with high damage, low rate of fire and short range.

-> The Sniper (80 gold)
1v1 type turret with high damage, very low rate of fire and very high range.

-> The Frozen (80 gold)
Area of effect type turret with the ability to slow down enemies around.

You'll face the same X waves on all maps.
Some maps are really hard to complete.
