the difference between the different elements in their appearance : to know it,
refer to the tileset.png file, in the assets folder. each block is arranged in
alphabetical order. Thus, the first one corresponds to A', the second to 'B', etc.

the first column must be empty, except for the last line, which must be contain
element B. We recommend continuing this schema over several columns, to give
the player time to prepare.
